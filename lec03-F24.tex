\section{Hardness Concentrate Bit}
We start by asking the following question: Is it possible to concentrate the strength of a one-way function into one bit? In particular, given a one-way function $f$, does there exist one bit that can be computed efficiently from the input $x$, but is hard to compute given $f(x)$?
\begin{definition}[Hard Concentrate Bit]
Let $f:\binset{n} \rightarrow \binset{n}$ be a one-way function.
$B:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ is a hard concentrate bit of $f$ if:
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] $B$ is computable by a polynomial time machine, and
\item[-] $\forall$ non-uniform PPT adversaries $\mathcal{A}$ we have that
	$$\Pr_{x\stackrel{\$}{\leftarrow} \binset{n}}[\mathcal{A}(1^n, f(x)) = B(x)] \leq \frac{1}{2} + \mathsf{negl}(n).$$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\noindent\textbf{A simple example.}
Let $f$ be a one-way function. Consider the one-way function $g(b, x) = 0 || f(x)$ and a hard concentrate bit $B(b, x) = b$.
Intuitively, the value $g(b, x)$ does not reveal any information about the first bit $b$, thus no information about the value $B(b, x)$ can be ascertained. Hence $\mathcal{A}$ cannot predict the first bit with a non-negligible advantage than a random guess. However, we are more interested in the case where the hard concentrate bit is hidden because of computational hardness and not information theoretic hardness.
\begin{remark}
Given a one-way function $f$, we can construct another one-way function $g$ with a hard concentrate bit. However, we may not be able to find a hard concentrate bit for $f$. In fact, it is an open question whether a hard concentrate bit exists for every one-way function.
\end{remark}


\bigskip
Intuitively, if a function $f$ is one-way, there should be a particular bit in the input $x$ that is hard to compute given $f(x)$. But this is not true:
\begin{claim}
If $f:\binset{n}\rightarrow \binset{n}$ is a one-way function, then there exists a one-way function $g:\binset{n+\log n}\rightarrow\binset{n+\log n}$ such that $\forall 1 \leq i \leq n+\log n$, $B_i(x) = x_i$ is not a hard concentrate bit, where $x_i$ is the $i^\text{th}$ bit of $x$.
\end{claim}
\proof
Define $g:\{0,1\}^{n+\log(n)} \rightarrow \{0,1\}^{n+\log(n)}$ as follows.
$$g(x,y) = f(x_{\bar y}) || x_y || y,$$
where $|x| = n, |y| = \log n$, $x_{\bar y}$ is all bits of $x$ except the $y^\text{th}$ bit, $x_y$ is the $y^\text{th}$ bit of $x$.

First, one can show that $g$ is still a one-way function. (We leave this as an exercise!)
We next show that $B_i$ is not a hard concentrate bit for $\forall 1 \leq i \leq n$ (clearly $B_i$ is not a hard concentrate bit for $n+1 \leq i \leq n+\log n$).
Construct an adversary $\mathcal{A}_i(1^{n+\log n}, f(x_{\bar y}) || x_y || y)$ that ``breaks'' $B_i$:
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] If $y \not= i$ then output a random bit;
\item[-] Otherwise output $x_y$.
\end{itemize}
\begin{align*}
& \Pr_{x, y}[\mathcal{A}(1^{n+\log n}, g(x,y)) = B_i(x)]\\
=& \Pr_{x, y}[\mathcal{A}(1^{n+\log n}, f(x_{\bar y}) || x_y || y) = x_i]\\
=& \frac{n-1}{n} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{n} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2n}.
\end{align*}
Hence $\mathcal{A}_i$ can guess the output of $B_i$ with greater than $\frac{1}{2} + \mathsf{negl}(n)$ probability.
\qed



\paragraph{Application: Coin tossing over the phone.} We next describe an application of hard concentrate bits to coin tossing.
Consider two parties trying to perform a coin tossing over the phone. In this setting the first party needs to declare its choice as the second one flips the coin. However, how can the first party trust the win/loss response from the second party?  In particular, if the first party calls out ``head'' and then the second party can just lie that it was ``tails.'' We can use hard concentrate bit of a (one-to-one) one-way function to  enable this applications.

Let $f$ be a (one-to-one) one-way function and $B$ be a hard concentrate bit for $f$. Consider the following protocol:
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] Party $P_1$ samples $x$ from $\{0,1\}^n$ uniformly at random and sends $y$, where $y = f(x)$, to party $P_2$.
\item[-] $P_2$ sends back a random bit $b$ sampled from $\{0,1\}$.
\item[-] $P_1$ sends back $(x, B(x))$ to $P_2$. $P_2$ aborts if $f(x) \neq y$.
\item[-]  Both parties output $B(x)\oplus b$.
\end{itemize}
Note that $P_2$ cannot guess $B(x)$ with a non-negligible advantage than $1/2$ as he sends back his $b$.
On the other hand, $P_1$ cannot flip the value $B(x)$ once it has sent $f(x)$ to $P_2$ because $f$ is one-to-one.


\subsection{Hard Concentrate Bit of any One-Way Permutation}
We now show that a slight modification of every one-way function has a hard concentrate bit. More formally,
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:hard-concentrate-bit}
Let  $f:\binset{n} \rightarrow \binset{n}$ be a one-way function.
Define a function $g:\binset{2n} \rightarrow \binset{2n}$ as follows:
$$g(x,r) = f(x) || r,$$
where $|x| = |r| =n$. Then we have that $g$ is one-way and that it has a hard concentrate bit, namely $B(x, r) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i r_i\mod 2$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{remark}
If $f$ is a (one-to-one) one-way function, then $g$ is also a (one-to-one) one-way function with hard concentrate bit $B(\cdot)$.
\end{remark}
\proof
We leave it as an exercise to show that $g$ is a one-way function and below we will prove that the function $B(\cdot)$ describe a hard concentrate bit of $g$. More specifically, we need to show that if there exists a non-uniform PPT  $\ma$ s.t. $\Pr_{x,r}[\ma(1^{2n},g(x,r)) = B(x,r)] \ge \frac{1}{2} + \epsilon(n)$, where $\epsilon$ is non-negligible, then there exists a non-uniform PPT $\mathcal{B}$ such that $\Pr_{x,r}[\mathcal{B}(1^{2n}, g(x,r)) \in g^{-1}(g(x,r))]$ is non-negligible. Below we use $E$ to denote the event that $\ma(1^{2n},g(x,r)) = B(x,r)$. We will provide our proof in a sequence of three steps of complexity: (1) the super simple case where we restrict to $\ma$ such that $\Pr_{x,r}[E] = 1$, (2) the simple case where we restrict to $\ma$ such that $\Pr_{x,r}[E] \geq \frac34 + \epsilon(n)$, and finally (3) the general case with $\Pr_{x,r}[E] \geq \frac12 + \epsilon(n)$.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{\underline{Super simple case.}}
Suppose that $\ma$ breaks the $B$ with perfect accuracy:
$$\Pr_{x,r}[E] =1.$$
We  now construct $\mathcal{B}$ that inverts $g$ with perfect accuracy.
Let $e^i$ be an $n$-bit string $0\cdots 0 1 0 \cdots0$, where only the $i$-th bit is $1$, the rest are all $0$.
On input $f(x)||R$, $\mathcal{B}$ does the following:

\medskip
\begin{algorithmic}
\For {$i=1$ \textbf{to} $n$}
    \State $x'_i \gets \ma(1^{2n}, f(x)||e^i)$
\EndFor
\State \Return $x'_1\cdots x'_n || R$
\end{algorithmic}
Observe that $B(x,e^i) = \sum_{j=1}^n x_je^i_j = x_i$. Therefore, the probability that $\mathcal{B}$ inverts a single bit successfully is,
$$\Pr_{x}\left[\ma(1^{2n}, f(x)||e^i)=x_i\right] =  \Pr_{x}\left[\ma(1^{2n}, f(x)||e^i)=B(x,e^i)\right] = 1.$$
Hence $\Pr_{x,r}[\mathcal{B}(1^{2n}, g(x,r)) = (x,r)] = 1$.


\bigskip
\noindent\textbf{\underline{Simple case.}}
Next moving on to the following more demanding case.
$$\Pr_{x,r}[E] \geq \frac{3}{4} + \epsilon(n),$$
 where $\epsilon$ is non-negligible.
Just like the super simple case, we describe our algorithm of $\mathcal{B}$ for inverting $g$.
On input $f(x)||R$, $\mathcal{B}$ proceeds as follows:

\medskip
\begin{algorithmic}
\For {$i = 1$ \textbf{to} $n$}
	\For {$t = 1$ \textbf{to} $T = \frac{n}{2\epsilon(n)^2}$}
		\State $r \stackrel{\$}{\leftarrow} \binset{n}$
    	\State $x_i^t \leftarrow \ma(f(x)|| r) \oplus \ma(f(x) || r+e^i)$
	\EndFor
	\State $x'_i \gets $ the majority of $\{x_i^1, \cdots, x_i^T\}$
\EndFor
\State \Return $x'_1\cdots x'_n||R$
\end{algorithmic}
Correctness of $\mathcal{B}$ given that $\ma$ calls output the correct answer follows by observing that $B(x,r) \oplus B(x, r\oplus e^i) = x_i$:
\begin{align*}
&B(x,r) \oplus B(x, r\oplus e^i)\\
=& \sum_j x_j r_j + \sum_j x_j (r_j \oplus e^i_j) \mod 2\\
=& \sum_{j \not= i} (x_j r_j + x_j r_j) + x_i r_i + x_i (r_i+1) \mod 2\\
=& x_i.
\end{align*}
The key technical challenge in proving that $\mathcal{B}$ inverts $g$ with non-negligible probability arises from the fact that the calls to $\ma$ made during one execution of $\mathcal{B}$ are not independent. In particular, all calls to $\ma$ share the same $x$ and the class $\ma(f(x)|| r)$ and $\ma(f(x) || r+e^i)$ use correlated randomness as well. We solve the first issue by showing that exists a large choices of values of $x$ for which $\ma$ still works with large probability. The later issue of lack of independent of $\ma(f(x)|| r)$ and $\ma(f(x) || r+e^i)$ will be solved using a union bound.

\noindent Formally, define the set $G$ of ``good'' $x$'s, which are easy for $\ma$  to predict:
$$G := \left\{x \left| \Pr_r \left[ E \right]\geq \frac{3}{4} + \frac{\epsilon(n)}{2} \right. \right\}.$$
We start by proving that the size of $G$ is not small. More formally we claim that,
$$\Pr_{x \stackrel{\$}{\leftarrow} \binset{n}}[x \in G] \geq \frac{\epsilon(n)}{2}.$$
Assume, that $\Pr_{x \stackrel{\$}{\leftarrow} \binset{n}}[x \in G] < \frac{\epsilon(n)}{2}$. Then we have the following contradiction:
\begin{align*}
\frac{3}{4} + \epsilon(n) \leq& \Pr_{x,r}[E]\\
=& \Pr_x [x \in G] \Pr_{r}[E| x\in G] + \Pr_x [x \notin G] \Pr_{r}[E | x\notin G]\\
< & \frac{\epsilon(n)}{2} \cdot 1 + 1\cdot \left(\frac{3}{4}+\frac{\epsilon(n)}{2}\right)  = \frac{3}{4} + \epsilon(n).
\end{align*}
For and fixed $x \in G$:
\begin{align*}
&\Pr_{r} \left[ \ma(f(x), r) \oplus \ma(f(x), r+e^i) = x_i \right]\\
=& \Pr_{r} \left[ \text{Both $\ma$'s are correct} \right] + \Pr_{r} \left[ \text{Both $\ma$'s are wrong} \right]\\
\geq& \Pr_{r} \left[ \text{Both $\ma$'s are correct} \right]\\
\geq& 1-2 \cdot \Pr_{r} \left[ \text{Either $\ma$ is correct} \right]\\
\geq& 1-2\left(\frac{1}{4} - \frac{\epsilon(n)}{2} \right)
= \frac{1}{2} + \epsilon(n).
\end{align*}
Let $Y_i^t$ be the indicator random variable that $x_i^t = x_i$ (namely, $Y_i^t=1$ with probability  $\Pr[x_i^t = x_i]$ and $Y_i^t=0$ otherwise).
Note that $Y_i^1, \cdots, Y_i^T$ are independent and identical random variables, and for all $t \in \{1,\ldots, T\}$ we have that $\Pr[Y_i^t=1] = \Pr[x_i^t = x_i] \geq \frac{1}{2} + \epsilon(n)$. Next we argue that majority of $x_i^1, \ldots x_i^T$ coincides with $x_i$ with high probability.
\begin{align*}
\Pr[x'_i \neq x_i]
=& \Pr\left[\sum_{t=1}^T Y_i^t \leq \frac{T}{2} \right]\\
=& \Pr\left[\sum_{t=1}^T  Y_i^t- \left(\frac{1}{2} + \epsilon(n) \right)T \leq \frac{T}{2} - \left(\frac{1}{2} + \epsilon(n) \right)T \right]\\
\leq& \Pr\left[ \left| \sum_{t=1}^T  Y_i^t- \left(\frac{1}{2} + \epsilon(n) \right)T \right| \geq \epsilon(n)T \right]\\
& \text{Let $X_1,\cdots,X_m$ be i.i.d. random variables taking values 0 or 1. Let $\Pr[X_i=1] = p$.}\\
& \text{By Chebyshev's Inequality, $\Pr\left[ \left| \sum X_i - pm \right| \geq \delta m \right] \leq \frac{1}{4\delta^2 m}$.}\\
\leq& \frac{1}{4\epsilon(n)^2T} = \frac{1}{2n}.
\end{align*}
Then, completing the argument,  we have
\begin{align*}
&\Pr_{x,r}[\mathcal{B}(1^{2n}, g(x,r)) = (x,r)]\\
\geq& \Pr_x [x \in G] \Pr[x'_1 = x_1, \cdots x'_n = x_n | x \in G]\\
\geq& \frac{\epsilon(n)}{2} \cdot \left(1- \sum_{i=1}^n\Pr[x'_i \neq x_i | x \in G]\right)\\
\geq& \frac{\epsilon(n)}{2} \cdot \left(1- n \cdot\frac{1}{2n} \right) =  \frac{\epsilon(n)}{4}.
\end{align*}



\bigskip
\noindent\textbf{\underline{Real Case.}} Now, we describe the final case where $\Pr_{x,r}[E] \geq \frac{1}{2} + \epsilon(n),$
 where $\epsilon(\cdot)$ is a non-negligible function. The key technical challenge in this case is that we cannot make two related calls to $\ma$ as was done in the simple case above. However, just using one call to $\ma$ seems insufficient. The key idea is to just guess one of those values. Very surprisingly this idea along with careful analysis magically works out.
Just like the previous two case we start by describing the algorithm $\mathcal{B}$. On input $f(x)||R$, $\mathcal{B}$ proceeds as follows:

\medskip
\begin{algorithmic}
\State $T = \frac{2n}{\epsilon(n)^2}$
	\For {$\ell = 1$ \textbf{to} $\log T$}
		\State $s_\ell \stackrel{\$}{\leftarrow} \binset{n}$
		\State $b_\ell \stackrel{\$}{\leftarrow} \{0,1\}$
	\EndFor
\For {$i = 1$ \textbf{to} $n$}
	\ForAll {$L \subseteq \{1,2,\cdots, \log T\}$}
		\State $S_L :=\bigoplus_{j \in L} s_j$
		\State $B_L := \bigoplus_{j \in L} b_j$
		\State $x_i^L \leftarrow B_L \oplus \ma(f(x) || S_L+e^i)$
	\EndFor
	\State $x'_i \gets $ the majority of $\{x_i^\emptyset, \cdots, x_i^{[\log T]}\}$
\EndFor
\State \Return $x'_1\cdots x'_n||R$
\end{algorithmic}

\medskip
The idea is the following. Let $b_\ell$ guess the value of $B(x,s_\ell)$, and with probability $\frac{1}{T}$ all the $b_{\ell}$'s are correct. In that case, it is easy to see that $B_L = B(x, S_L)$ for every $L$. If we follow the same argument as above, then it remains to bound the probability that $\ma(f(x) || S_L+e^i)=B(x, S_L + e^i)$. However there is a subtle issue. Now the events $Y_i^\emptyset, \cdots, Y_i^{[\log T]}$ are not independent any more. But we can still show that they are pairwise independent, and the Chebyshev's Inequality still holds. Now we give the formal proof. \\
Just as in the simple case, we define the set $G$ as
$$G := \left\{x \left| \Pr_r \left[ E \right]\geq \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\epsilon(n)}{2} \right. \right\},$$
and with an identical argument we obtain that
$$\Pr_{x \stackrel{\$}{\leftarrow} \binset{n}}[x \in G] \geq \frac{\epsilon(n)}{2}.$$\\
Correctness of $\mathcal{B}$ follows from the fact in case $b_\ell = B(x,s_\ell)$ for every $\ell \in [\log T]$ then $\forall L \subseteq [\log T]$, it holds that (we use the notation $(s)_k$ to denote the $k^{th}$ bit of $s$)
$$B(x,S_L) = \sum_{k=1}^n x_k \left(\bigoplus_{j \in L} s_j\right)_k =  \sum_{k=1}^n x_k \sum_{j \in L} \left(s_j\right)_k = \sum_{j \in L} \sum_{k=1}^n x_k \left(s_j\right)_k = \sum_{j \in L}B(x,s_j) = \sum_{j\in L} b_j  = B_L.$$
Next given that $b_\ell = B(x,s_\ell), \forall \ell \in [\log T]$ and $x\in G$ we bound the probability,
\begin{align*}
\Pr_{r} \left[  B_L \oplus \ma(f(x) || S_L+e^i) = x_i \right]
=& \Pr_{r} \left[ B(x,S_L) \oplus \ma(f(x) || S_L+e^i) = x_i \right]\\
=& \Pr_{r} \left[ \ma(f(x) || S_L+e^i) =  B(x,S_L +e^i) \right]\\
\geq& \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\epsilon(n)}{2}.
\end{align*}
For $b_\ell = B(x,s_\ell), \forall \ell \in [\log T]$ and $x\in G$, let $Y_i^L$ be the indicator random variable that $x_i^L = x_i$.
Notice that $Y_i^\emptyset, \cdots, Y_i^{[\log T]}$ are pairwise independent and $\Pr[Y_i^L=1] = \Pr[x_i^L = x_i] \geq \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\epsilon(n)}{2}$.
\begin{align*}
\Pr[x'_i \neq x_i] =& \Pr\left[\sum_{L \subseteq [\log T]} Y_i^L \leq \frac{T}{2} \right]\\
=& \Pr\left[\sum_{L \subseteq [\log T]} Y_i^L - \left(\frac{1}{2} +  \frac{\epsilon(n)}{2} \right)T \leq \frac{T}{2} - \left(\frac{1}{2} +  \frac{\epsilon(n)}{2} \right)T \right]\\
\leq& \Pr\left[ \left| \sum_{L \subseteq [\log T]} Y_i^L - \left(\frac{1}{2} +  \frac{\epsilon(n)}{2} \right)T \right| \geq \frac{\epsilon(n)}{2} T \right]\\
& \text{(By Theorem~\ref{thm:Chebyshev})}\\
\leq& \frac{1}{4\left( \frac{\epsilon(n)}{2}\right)^2T} = \frac{1}{2n}.
\end{align*}
Then, completing the proof, we have that
\begin{align*}
\Pr_{x,r}[&\mathcal{B}(1^{2n}, g(x,r)) = (x,r)]\\
\geq&  \Pr\left[\forall \ell \in [\log T], b_\ell = B(x,s_\ell)\right] \\& \cdot  \Pr_x [x \in G] \Pr[x'_1 = x_1, \cdots x'_n = x_n | \forall \ell \in [\log T], b_\ell = B(x,s_\ell), x \in G]\\
\geq& \frac{1}{T} \cdot \frac{\epsilon(n)}{2} \cdot \left(1- \sum_{i=1}^n\Pr[x'_i \neq x_i | \forall \ell \in [\log T], b_\ell = B(x,s_\ell), x \in G]\right)\\
\geq& \frac{\epsilon(n)^2}{2n} \cdot \frac{\epsilon(n)}{2} \cdot \left(1- n \cdot\frac{1}{2n} \right) =  \frac{\epsilon(n)^3}{8n}.
\end{align*}
\qed

\noindent\textbf{Pairwise Independence and Chebyshev's Inequality.} Here, for the sake of completeness, we prove the Chebyshev's Inequality.
\begin{definition}[Pairwise Independence]
A collection of random variables $\{X_1,\cdots,X_m\}$ is said to be \emph{pairwise independent} if for every pair of random variables $(X_i, X_j), i \neq j$  and every pair of values $(v_i,v_j)$, it holds that
$$\Pr[X_i = v_i, X_j = v_j] = \Pr[X_i = v_i]\Pr[X_j = v_j].$$
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Chebyshev's Inequality]\label{thm:Chebyshev}
Let $X_1,\hdots,X_m$ be pairwise independent and identically distributed binary random variables. In particular, for every $i \in [m]$, $\Pr[X_i = 1] = p$ for some $p\in [0,1]$ and $\Pr[X_i=0]=1-p$. Then it holds that
$$\Pr\left[\left|\sum_{i=1}^m X_i - pm\right| \geq \delta m\right] \leq \frac{1}{4\delta^2m}.$$
\end{theorem}

\proof
Let $Y = \sum_i X_i$. Then
\begin{align*}
\Pr\left[\left|\sum_{i=1}^m X_i - pm\right| > \delta m\right] &=
\Pr\left[\left(\sum_{i=1}^m X_i - pm\right)^2> \delta^2 m^2\right]\\
&\leq \frac{\mathbb{E}\left[\left|Y - pm\right|^2\right]}{\delta^2m^2}\\
&= \frac{\text{Var}(Y)}{\delta^2m^2}\\
\end{align*}
Observe that
\begin{align*}
\text{Var}(Y) &= \mathbb{E}\left[Y^2\right] - \left(\mathbb{E}[Y]\right)^2\\
&= \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^m \left( \mathbb{E}\left[X_iX_j\right] - \mathbb{E}\left[X_i\right] \mathbb{E}\left[X_j\right]\right)\\
& \text{By pairwise independence, for $i \neq j$,  
$\mathbb{E}\left[X_iX_j\right] = \mathbb{E}\left[X_i\right] \mathbb{E}\left[X_j\right]$.}\\
&= \sum_{i=1}^m \mathbb{E}\left[X_i^2\right] - \mathbb{E}\left[X_i\right]^2\\
&= mp(1-p).
\end{align*}
Hence
$$\Pr\left[\left|\sum_{i=1}^m X_i - pm\right| \geq\delta m\right] \leq \frac{mp(1-p)}{\delta^2m^2} \leq \frac{1}{\delta^2m}.$$
\qed

%\subsection{Proof: Fixing a Value in a One-way Function}
%
%\begin{theorem}
%Given a one-way function $f : \binset{n} \rightarrow \binset{m}$ and constants $x_0 \in \binset{n}$, $y_0 \in \binset{m}$, $\exists g : \binset{n} \rightarrow \binset{m}$ such that $g(x_0) = y_0$ where $g$ is a one-way function.\\

%  y_0 & : x = x_0 \\
%  f(x) & : x \neq x_0
%\end{array}
%\right.$
%
%Suppose there is an adversary $A$ that can break $g$ with non-negligible probability $\mu(n)$.\\
%
%So, we have $\mu(n) = \underset{x \overset{\$}{\leftarrow} \binset{n}}{Pr} [ A(g(x)) \in g^{-1}(g(x)) ] = \sum\limits_{x \in \binset{n}} Pr(X = x) Pr [ A(g(x)) \in g^{-1}(g(x)) ]$\\
%
%Since $x$ is uniformly distributed, $Pr[X = x] = \frac{1}{2^n}$.  We can split it into the cases $x : g(x) = y_0$ and $x : g(x) \neq y_0$:\\
%
%$\mu(n) = \big[ \frac{1}{2^n} \sum\limits_{x \in \binset{n}, g(x) = y_0} Pr [ A(y_0) \in g^{-1}(y_0)) ] \big] + \big[ \frac{1}{2^n} \sum\limits_{x \in \binset{n}, g(x) \neq y_0} Pr [ A(g(x)) \in g^{-1}(g(x)) ] \big]$.\\
%
%Let $p = | \{ x : g(x) = y_0 \} |$.  Consider the adversary $M$ where $M(y) = x_1$ for any $y$, where $x_1$ is a value of $x$ where $f(x_1) = y_0$.  Thus, $M$ breaks $f$ for any input where $f(x) = y_0$, of which there are $p - 1$ or $p$ (depending on whether $f(x_0) = y_0$).  So, the probability with which $M$ breaks $f$ is $\frac{p-1}{2^n}$ or $\frac{p}{2^n}$.  Either way, since $f$ is a one-way function, this implies that $\frac{p}{2^n}$ is a negligible function.\\
%
%Now, since $Pr [ A(y_0) \in g^{-1}(g(x_0)) ] \leq 1$, we have:\\
%
%$\mu(n) \leq \frac{p}{2^n} + \sum\limits_{x \in \binset{n}, g(x) \neq y_0} Pr [ A(g(x)) \in g^{-1}(g(x)) ]$\\
%
%Notice that for any $x$ such that $g(x) \neq y_0$, we have $f(x) = g(x)$ and $f^{-1}(f(x)) = g^{-1}(g(x))$.\\
%
%So $\mu(n) \leq \frac{p}{2^n} + \frac{1}{2^n}\sum\limits_{x \in \binset{n}, g(x) \neq y_0} Pr [ A(f(x)) \in f^{-1}(f(x)) ]$\\
%
%Thus, if we consider $A$ as an adversary for $f$, then we get:\\
%
%$\underset{x \overset{\$}{\leftarrow} \binset{n}}{Pr} [ A(f(x)) \in f^{-1}(f(x)) ] \; \geq \; \frac{1}{2^n}\sum\limits_{x \in \binset{n}, g(x) \neq y_0} Pr [ A(f(x)) \in f^{-1}(f(x)) ] \; \geq \; \mu(n) - \frac{p}{2^n}$\\
%
%$\mu(n)$ is non-negligible and $\frac{p}{2^n}$ is negligible, and so, $\mu(n) - \frac{p}{2^n}$ is non-negligible.  Thus $A$ is an adversary that breaks $f$ with non-negligible probability.  \qed
